## Our Development Process
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Report a Bug or Submit a Feature Request
We use GitHub issues to track bugs and feature requests. You can open a new issue [here](https://github.com/TNT-Hoopsnake/judy/issues/new).

## Submitting a Pull Request

Judy uses [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) for all code changes. We welcome your pull requests for an existing issue:

1. Make sure that a github issue exists for the pull request you are making
2. Clone the repo and create your branch from `main`.
    - Bugfix branches should be named `bugfix-<issue number>`
    - Feature branches should be named `feature-<issue number>`
    - Security patches and high severity fixes should be named `patch-<issue-number>`
3. Ensure that relevant tests are added to `/tests`. Integration tests are preferred to unit tests.
4. Push your code to the remote branch you created.
4. Ensure the github CI pipeline passes.
6. Create a pull request to merge your branch into `main`.
