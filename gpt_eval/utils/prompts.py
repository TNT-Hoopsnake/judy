BASE_PROMPT = '''
[Instruction]
Act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the response provided by an AI assistant to the user question displayed below. Your evaluation should consider multiple factors, including the following dimensions: accuracy, coherence, factuality, completeness, relevance, depth, creativity, and level of detail. Assign a score of 1-10 to each dimension, with 10 being the best score. Be stringent in your judgment; reserve a score of 10 for truly exceptional responses, which are rare.

[Guidelines for Evaluation]

    Accuracy: Assess the extent to which the response aligns with factual information without errors. A high score should be awarded to responses that are factually sound and accurately answer the User's queries.

    Coherence: Evaluate how well the response flows logically and how well ideas are connected. A high score should be given to responses that are easy to follow.

    Factuality: Examine the degree to which the response is grounded in factual accuracy and avoids speculation or misinformation. High scores should be reserved for responses that are highly factual.

    Completeness: Consider whether the response adequately addresses the user's query, providing all necessary information. High scores should go to responses that are comprehensive.

    Relevance: Assess whether the response is directly related to the user's question and does not veer off-topic. High scores should be for highly relevant responses.

    Depth: Evaluate the extent to which the response delves into the topic, providing valuable insights or additional information. High scores should go to in-depth responses.

    Creativity: Consider whether the response displays creative thinking or novel approaches. High scores should be given to responses that demonstrate creativity when appropriate.

    Level of Detail: Examine whether the response offers a sufficient level of detail, catering to the user's needs. High scores should be given to responses with rich detail when necessary.

[Important Notes]

    Judges should use neutral, objective language in their evaluations, avoiding subjective terms.
    Please provide a clear rationale for each score, citing specific examples from the response that justify the assigned score.
    Consider the interplay between the dimensions; a response may excel in one dimension but falter in another, which should be reflected in your evaluation.
    If the Assistant fails to answer the question, it should recieve a 0 in all categories. It is not acceptable for an Assistant to fail to provide any response to the User.
    The Assistant's response should be a full answer to the user query, with no additional context needed. The user shouldn't have to reference any Context to understand the Assistant's response.
    Non-responses should be marked down in all categories, including accuracy, coherence, and factuality

[Response Format]

    Judges should respond in the following format, substituting 'X' for the numeric score in each category:

    Accuracy: X
    Coherence: X
    Factuality: X
    Completeness: X
    Relevance: X
    Depth: X
    Creativity: X
    Level of Detail: X

    Judges should then include a paragraph explaining their rationale, justifying their decision in each category.

The Assistant has been given a piece of text to summarize. You must judge how well the message in the original text has been summarized by the Assistant, according to the given criteria.
Judges should score the Assistant's summarization dependant on how well the messages in the original text are reflected in the summarization.
If important pieces of information are missing, the Judge must lower the score for the Assistant.
Judges should take into account how much of the Original Text the Assistant managed to remove in its Summary.
If the Summary is close to the length of the Original Text, it is not a very good summary, the Assistant has simply repeated the Original Text.
A Summary that contains all the important information from the Original Text while managing to be much shorter is a excellent response.

Compare the Assistant's responses to the answers of the questions above. A good assistant response will be similar to the given correct answer.
Do not split your evaluation per question. Perform your evaluation taking into consideration how well the Assistant did at answering all the questions.
Your evaluation must consider all Assistant responses, not just its first response.

If the assistant responds with "CANNOTANSWER", determine if the correct answer to the question was "CANNOTANSWER". 
If the correct answer is "CANNOTANSWER" that response should impact the evaluation positively, as the answer to the question could not be determined using the given context.
If the correct answer is not "CANNOTANSWER", that response should impact the evaluation negatively, as it did not assist the user despite being provided with the information needed to do so.
"CANNOTANSWER" is only a valid response if the correct answer to the question is "CANNOTANSWER". If this is true, the Assistant has done a good job.
