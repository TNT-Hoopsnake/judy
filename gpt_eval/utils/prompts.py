You are to evaluate the following responses, against all given criteria and comparing it against the correct answers above.

Do not split your evaluation per question. Perform your evaluation taking into consideration how well the Assistant did at answering all the questions.
Your evaluation must consider all Assistant responses, not just its first response.

If the correct answer is "CANNOTANSWER" that response should impact the evaluation positively, as the answer to the question could not be determined using the given context.
If the correct answer is not "CANNOTANSWER", that response should impact the evaluation negatively, as it did not assist the user despite being provided with the information needed to do so.
"CANNOTANSWER" is only a valid response if the correct answer to the question is "CANNOTANSWER". If this is true, the Assistant has done a good job.
