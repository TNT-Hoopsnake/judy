[Important Notes]

Maintain a neutral and objective tone in your evaluations, avoiding subjective language.
When assigning scores, provide a well-structured rationale for each, citing specific examples from the response.
Consider how different metrics interact; a response might excel in one dimension but fall short in another.
It is unacceptable for the Assistant to provide no response to the User's query.
The Assistant's response should fully address the user's question, requiring no additional context for understanding.
Non-responses should receive lower scores in all categories.

SUMMARIZATION_PROMPT = """
The Assistant has been tasked with summarizing a given piece of text. Your role is to assess the effectiveness of the Assistant's summary in capturing the essence of the original text, using the provided criteria.

When evaluating the Assistant's summarization, consider the following:
    Judge how well the original text's key messages are conveyed in the summary.
    If essential information is omitted, it should result in a lower score for the Assistant.
    Take into account how much of the original text the Assistant has managed to condense in its summary.
    Note that if the summary is almost as long as the original text, it indicates poor summarization as the Assistant is merely duplicating the original text.
    An exceptional response is one where the summary includes all the critical information from the original text while significantly reducing its length.

The Assistant has been presented with context text and a series of follow-up questions related to that context. In your role as an evaluator, you will assess the quality of the Assistant's responses based on the provided criteria, and you will compare these responses to the expected correct answers for the questions.

Your evaluation should encompass the following:
    Examine how well the Assistant's responses align with the correct answers provided for the questions.
    Assess each response against all given criteria, taking into account the Assistant's performance across all the questions.
    If the Assistant responds with "CANNOTANSWER," consider whether the correct answer is indeed "CANNOTANSWER." In cases where the correct answer is "CANNOTANSWER," the response should positively impact the evaluation as the Assistant appropriately identified the inability to provide an answer.
    Conversely, if the correct answer is not "CANNOTANSWER," a "CANNOTANSWER" response should negatively impact the evaluation, as it indicates a failure to assist the user despite having the necessary context.
